Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 730 images.
Plants are annotated in Tensorflow Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 256x256 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via contrast stretching

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -16 and +16 degrees
* Random shear of between -9째 to +9째 horizontally and -12째 to +12째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -27 and +27 percent
